# resubmission
 The previous week, In my status page, i had only displayed three sections for tasks submitted, not submitted, and not started, but the data weren't showing in the appropriate sections using codes; last week i filled these with data. Each time someone adds a new task it shows in the correct section. I used a array.filter method to search for items with certain statuses.
 The previous week, my "change status of tasks saved" in the "Edit page second section" wasn't working at all. Now, if someone enters the titles of something for editing, a new page that was hidden shows up with all the information for that task already filled in the input areas, the user only has to modify what they wish to modify. That allows for easy editing. And the tasks are edited immediately.
 I have used "The clear before show method on all my input areas" so that all items are cleared.
 I have displayed titles using codes so that users know which titles to type if they want delete, or edit.
In bulk, this week, i worked most on the javascript for the pages to work.
